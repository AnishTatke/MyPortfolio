                <div class="intro">
                   I am a Computer Science Engineer Gradutaed from MIT World Peace University, Pune. I have lived
                   in Pune since my birth. I have always been keenly interested in technology and computers since my
                   introduced them to me when I was young. I experimnted alot on these computers and various machines
                   and tried to find solutions to problems unknowningly. That motivated me to choose this field. I
                   have, since then, acquired a lot of knowledge and skill related to computers. Still, I feel the 
                   hunger of grasping more information from this vast pool of knowledge. Since the freshman year of 
                   my graduation timeline, I have implemented a lot of projects in various domains. This paricular 
                   portfolio shows the overview of all the projects and the skills that I have implemented which have 
                   helped me gain immense experience and various opputunities. I got the chance to work at a leading 
                   healthcare and IOT based company called DeeDeeLabs Pvt Ltd. Here I worked as a intern for 3 months. 
                   Currently I am working as a trainee intern in India's most leading company in the domain of AI-ML/Cloud 
                   solutions.

                            <p class="image_desc">I have worked on multiple projects related to AI and Machine Learning. 
                                Specifically Machine Learning, which is the backbone of AI and Data Science. Most of my 
                                initial projects have been related to classification problems. Various datasets available 
                                from goverment sites and public repositories have motivated me to create robust prediction 
                                models with high accuracies. Later half of my projects go deep in the field of Natural 
                                Language, Deep Learning and Compuer Vision. Here I ahd to create efficient models from huge 
                                datasets to classify on images, text, audio and time series data. Trying various values and 
                                hyperparameters has given a higher advantage in understanding of these concepts. My capstone
                                 project related to computer vision for smart city development. My team and me created a 
                                 mobile application on the same which integrated the model into the mobile.</p>

                            <p class="image_desc">In the field of software and database, I have created 
                                multiple projects by using various languages and frameworks. Primarily Java 
                                and Python have been the base languages in most of the projects. I have 
                                created various Ticket booking softwares with Java and SQL database and 
                                a part of my college projects. Due to need for various compatibility, 
                                I have worked on different types of databases like relational, no-sql, 
                                graph-based, etc. Thus I have projects on each of these databases too. 
                                This has given me a advantage and a better understanding into databases 
                                and software application development cycle. Finally I have worked on Game 
                                Developement in my internship, which is considered to be as the most 
                                difficult type of software development. I worked with C# and Unity of 
                                this project to create seamless and  smooth games.</p>

                                on a limited but diverse projects of web developement. These projects have been 
                                mostly related to blog-type websites or e-commerece websites. The basics of this 
                                being HTML, CSS and Javascript, which I am slightly well-versed with. Other

                                my internship. Still a lot of knowledge in this domain is unknown to me that I need
